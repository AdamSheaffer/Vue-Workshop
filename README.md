# Hello Vue

Welcome to the Vue.js workshop! In this course we're going to explore all the building blocks of Vue.js--a progressive front end framework with the ability to scale between a lightweight library and full featured framework depending on your application's needs.

## Who is this course for?

This course is designed for novice JavaScript developers. It is perfect for an NSS alum who is interested in learning more about front end development. It assumes you have a background in React as it will occasionally comparisons along the way to React features. If you liked React during your time at NSS, we think you'll ðŸ’šðŸ’šðŸ’š Vue.

It assumes you are familiar with building applications with components, and are comfortable with managing state throughout a component tree. Familiarity with modern JavaScript features will be helpful, but not necessary. If there is a class where we will employ a ES2015 feature, there will be a video covering it for you to watch beforehand. That way all our class time can be spent focusing on Vue.

## How is this different from React?

Since React is just meant to be a library, it means that certain things like patterns, best practices, and tooling (i.e. React Router, Redux, etc) are largely left up to the community. As a result you'll find that a React application built by one team is very different than one built by another team.

Vue allows developers the ability to opt in to tools for routing and state management, however they are built and managed by the core Vue team. The Vue community also largely agrees on how Vue apps should be built, and even has an official style guide which we'll explore later. The benefit of this is that a Vue developer should be able to join any new project and start being productive immediately.

If you want a more in depth look at how Vue is different from React, you can read about it on the [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/comparison.html)

## Goals for this course

- Gain an understanding of all parts of a Vue component and building a component tree
- Learn the different ways of managing state in a Vue application
- Learn techniques for modularity and reusability in the Vue ecosystem
- Learn to leverage the Vue router to create Single Page Applications
- Conform to Vue best practices as outlined by the Official Style Guide
- Build a portfolio by deploying all applications
